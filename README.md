## Template Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.
There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.
Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
| Command | Action |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install` | Installs dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
| `npm run astro ...` | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI |
